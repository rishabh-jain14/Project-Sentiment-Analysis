# Sentiment Analysis:

Analysis of the performance of any article, action, reaction, product, process or event, can be done by analyzing the sentiment of the reciprocating feedback for the same. Through machine learning algorithms and python libraries, I have implemented a machine learning model useful in the prediction of the emotional sentiment of textual data.
The model takes text data as input and predicts the sentiment of that textual data as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset Used:
Amazon Food Reviews (Kaggle)
GOP Presidential Elections Twitter Dataset (Kaggle)
